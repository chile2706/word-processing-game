# word-processing-game
This is a Wordle-like program in which the player guesses a word and receives feedback on how close their guess was to the hidden solution word. For each letter in the solution word, the game tells the player if the letter is in the correct location, if the letter exists in the word but is not in the correct location, or if the letter does not exist in the
word. The player gets a certain number of attempts to figure out the hidden word from the given feedback.
